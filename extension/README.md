# ðŸŽ¯ Fokus - Chrome Extension

A productivity-focused Chrome extension that helps you stay focused by blocking distracting websites with customizable timers.

## Features

- **Focus Mode**: Block access to distracting websites
- **Timer-based Focus**: Set custom focus durations (15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes)
- **Visual Blocking**: Beautiful overlay prevents access to blocked sites
- **Give Up Option**: Easy exit from timer-based focus sessions
- **Per-site Control**: Independent focus mode for each website
- **Notifications**: Get notified when focus sessions complete

## How It Works

1. **Click the extension icon** on any website you want to focus away from
2. **Choose your focus mode**:
   - Start Focus Mode (indefinite)
   - Set a timer (15-60 minutes)
3. **When you revisit the site**, you'll see a focus mode overlay
4. **For timed sessions**, watch the countdown and use "Give Up" if needed
5. **Turn off focus mode** anytime from the overlay or extension popup
